# Testing a Real World App Built with Nextjs with Cypress

This application is for the [Testing your first application course](https://learn.cypress.io/testing-your-first-application) on [learn.cypress.io](https://learn.cypress.io/).

I needed an app source code, and I found this one very interesting.

The `initial` branch is the main branch for this repo and contains the app source code. The [final](https://github.com/...) branch will contain all the tests scripts written for this app.

This project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in using Cypress, showcasing my knowledge and skills. I will ensure the test scripts are error-free and their content is presented clearly and concisely.

To clone this project more precisely the initial branch, I recommend you navigate to [cypress-io / cypress-realworld-testing-course-app](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-testing-course-app) on [Cypress Github Page](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-testing-course-app).
